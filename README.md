# Genxyz

A 3D mind mapping application, written in ASP.Net, using AJAX (migrating to WebSockets) and three.js. Find a currently active version over at https://genxyz.cmoastudios.com

Genxyz is designed to try and bypass one of the major problems with mind mapping - running out of space. By creative use of the Z axis, we're able to greatly expand on a traditional mindmap that is normally bound to simple X and Y Coordinates. The code is written in ASP.Net and will be using SignalR in the near future.

Please feel free to contribute! All help is appreciated and wanted. Currently we're looking at the following:

Migrating to SignalR WebSockets instead of Ajax pulls and calls.
Improving the 3d controls and display.
More features - tags, paths and customization.
A "tag" is simply a label that is put onto any given node. A "path", on the other hand, marks the node as part of a collective, primarily intended to help seperate processes.
